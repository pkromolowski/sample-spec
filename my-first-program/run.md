## Overview

This COBOL code pattern demonstrates a simple application that reads data from three input files, merges them into a single sorted list, and writes the sorted list to an output file. 

## Package/module name

This code doesn't appear to be organized into packages or modules in the traditional sense.

## Class/file name

The primary source code file is named `fxsort.cbl`.

## Detailed Documentation

**Function/Method: `MAIN`**

* **Description:** This is the main program entry point. It initializes variables, reads data from the input files, merges the data, sorts the merged data, and writes the sorted data to the output file.
* **Parameters:** None
* **Return Values:** None
* **Important Logic:**
    * Reads data from three input files (`INPUT1`, `INPUT2`, `INPUT3`).
    * Merges the data from all three files into a single list.
    * Sorts the merged list using a sorting algorithm (not explicitly shown in the provided code).
    * Writes the sorted list to an output file (`OUTPUT`).

**Function/Method: `READ_DATA` (Assumed)**

* **Description:** This function (not explicitly defined in the provided code) is assumed to read data from a specific input file.
* **Parameters:**
    * `filename`: A string representing the name of the input file.
* **Return Values:**
    * A list of data read from the input file.
* **Important Logic:**
    * Opens the specified input file.
    * Reads data from the file line by line.
    * Parses each line of data into individual records.
    * Returns a list of parsed data records.

**Function/Method: `MERGE_DATA` (Assumed)**

* **Description:** This function (not explicitly defined in the provided code) is assumed to merge data from multiple input lists into a single list.
* **Parameters:**
    * `list1`: A list of data records from the first input file.
    * `list2`: A list of data records from the second input file.
    * `list3`: A list of data records from the third input file.
* **Return Values:**
    * A single merged list containing all data records from the three input lists.
* **Important Logic:**
    * Iterates through each list, comparing data records based on a defined criteria (not explicitly shown).
    * Appends data records to the merged list in a sorted or desired order.

**Function/Method: `SORT_DATA` (Assumed)**

* **Description:** This function (not explicitly defined in the provided code) is assumed to sort the merged data list using a sorting algorithm.
* **Parameters:**
    * `merged_list`: A list of data records to be sorted.
* **Return Values:**
    * A sorted list of data records.
* **Important Logic:**
    * Implements a sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort) to arrange the data records in a specific order (ascending or descending).



## Key Variables and Data Structures

* **`input_files`**: An array or list containing the names of the three input files.
* **`output_file`**: A string representing the name of the output file.
* **`merged_data`**: A list or array containing all the data records read from the input files and merged together.
* **`sorted_data`**: A list or array containing the sorted data records.

## Dependencies and Libraries

* **COBOL Compiler:** This code requires a COBOL compiler to be installed and configured.
* **JCL (Job Control Language):** The code relies on JCL to execute the compilation and execution steps.
* **Operating System:** This code is designed to run on a z/OS operating system.

## Pseudo Code

```
// Main Program
1. Initialize variables: input_files, output_file
2. Read data from each input file using READ_DATA function:
    * For each file in input_files:
        * Call READ_DATA function with filename
        * Append data to merged_data list
3. Merge data from all input files using MERGE_DATA function:
    * Call MERGE_DATA function with merged_data lists
    * Store merged data in merged_data variable
4. Sort merged data using SORT_DATA function:
    * Call SORT_DATA function with merged_data
    * Store sorted data in sorted_data variable
5. Write sorted data to output file:
    * Open output_file for writing
    * Write each element in sorted_data to the file
    * Close output_file
6. End program execution



```

**Note:** The pseudo code assumes the existence of functions `READ_DATA`, `MERGE_DATA`, and `SORT_DATA`, which are not explicitly defined in the provided code.
